# 1. Switch from Telmate/terraform-provider-proxmox to bpg/terraform-provider-proxmox

Date: 2025-03-19

## Status

accepted

## Context

Despite my inexperience with terraform generally, the Telmate provider seems less full-featured than the bpg one.

## Decision

Switch over to using the bpg provider.

## Consequences

Hopefully more features open up. Certianly the examples have some fancy stuff like generating ssh keys that looks useful.
